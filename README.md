See doc/auug97.pdf to see why recursive make is considered harmful!  Just don't do it!  Better ways exist.

NRMF is my own attempt (based on prior art whose source I've long since forgotten) at making a non-recursive framework for new C/C++/Objective-C applications.

This code dates back to 1998 as I recall, so it's been 16 years since I last used this framework, at least at the time I'm pushing this commit.
As a result, details on how best to use this tool is hazy; however, as I'm planning on working on a new C++/wxWidgets project now, I'll probably refresh my memory and update the docs as I run into senior moments.

OR, if you simply must know now, feel free to open an issue and ask any questions.  I'd be happy to help.

I'm uploading this project primarily to preserve my work on this project.
